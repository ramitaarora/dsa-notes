# Dijkstra's Algorithm

Dijkstraâ€™s algorithm is a method for finding the shortest distance from a given point to every other point in a weighted graph. The algorithm works by keeping track of all the distances and updating the distances as it conducts a breadth-first search. A common application of this algorithm is to find the quickest route from one destination to another.
