# Graph Traversals

## Depth-First Search
Simply put, a depth-first graph search continues down a path until it reaches the end. It is helpful for determining if a path exists between two vertices. DFS has many applications, including topological sorting and detecting cycles, but one of the more interesting real-world applications is that it can be used to solve problems that have a singular correct answer (a path between the start state and end state), such as a sudoku exercise.

## Breadth-First Search
On the other hand, a breadth-first graph search approach checks the values of all neighboring vertices before moving into another level of depth. This is an incredibly inefficient way to find just any path between two vertices, but itâ€™s an excellent way to identify the shortest path between them. Because of this, BFS is helpful for figuring out directions from one place to another.
